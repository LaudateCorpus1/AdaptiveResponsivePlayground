============================

Adaptive Responsive Web Design:  Only  those elements deemed appropriate exist on each experience.  Offers better performance on bandwidth-constrained devices.  Adaptive-Responsive Design is about creating one design and code base capable of delivering the best user experience across all channels:  Omni channel [mobile, tablet, laptop/desktop, hotspots, store display, billboards, etc.]  Adaptive:  adapts to specific situations/surroundings; in other words, how much data gets sent back from the model to the view depends on the form factor or screen size.  Responsive:  to display optimally on different screens; in other words, how/where/ what widgets get display on the view depending on the form factor or screen size.
